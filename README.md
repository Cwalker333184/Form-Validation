# Form-Validation

This project demonstrates two different types of form validation: **HTML5 built-in validation** and **custom JavaScript validation**. It is intended to showcase how validation can enhance user experience and ensure data accuracy before submission.

##  Files Included

- `index.html` – Contains two forms: one using HTML5 validation and another using JavaScript validation.
- `style.css` – Adds visual feedback for valid and invalid form fields.
- `script.js` – Contains JavaScript logic for custom validation of the form.

##  Features

### HTML5 Validation Form
- Username field with a minimum of 5 characters.
- Valid email format check.
- Password field with required length.

### JavaScript Validation Form
- Username field validated for length (min. 5 characters) via JavaScript.
- Realtime feedback and validation alerts.
